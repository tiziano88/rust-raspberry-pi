# Install the Raspberry Pi toolchain.
#
# Note that Ubuntu offers a package called `gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf`; despite the name, that
# compiles only for armv7 and is not suitable for armv6 cross compilation. If you have that
# installed on your machine, please uninstall it first, and then install the one from the official
# raspberry pi tool repository as described here.
#
# There is also a `gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi` package (note the missing `hf`), which does not use the
# FPU and instead relies on software emulation for floating point instructions. In my experience
# this is both slower and also produces some very weird behaviours in some cases where floating
# point computations are required, probably due to bugs in the compiler.
#
# In particular, if you compile with that and try to run the resulting executable on an armv6 core,
# you will get an `illegal instruction` error almost immediately. You can also use the `readelf
# --arch-specific <bin>` command in order to verify for which architecture a binary is compiled for
# (the output will contain either `v6` or `v7` as `Tag_CPU_arch`).
